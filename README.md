# Neuro-EarlyDetect: Collaborate on Next-Gen Neurodegenerative Disease Detection

Welcome to **Neuro-EarlyDetect**, a research-driven project aiming to **detect neurodegenerative diseases at their earliest stages using non-invasive methods**. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and cross-disciplinary collaboration, we hope to make earlier diagnosis possible—paving the way for better patient outcomes and a brighter, healthier future.

---

## Why This Matters
- **Early Intervention**: Catching symptoms at the earliest stages can significantly slow disease progression.  
- **Non-Invasive Approach**: Traditional tests can be uncomfortable and time-consuming. We aim to reduce patient burden and improve accessibility.  
- **Collaboration is Key**: We bring together neuroscientists, data scientists, medical professionals, and engineers to create a powerful, unified approach.  

---

## Our Vision
The **Neuro-EarlyDetect** project focuses on researching novel biomarkers and innovative detection methods to spot early signs of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases. With a year-long collaboration plan, we’ll combine expertise from multiple fields to create practical tools, build proof-of-concept prototypes, and share findings with the broader research community.

## 12-Month Collaboration Plan

Here’s a glimpse of our yearly plan to develop, test, and refine our non-invasive detection methods:

1. **Month 1–2: Ideation and Onboarding**
   - Brainstorm techniques for early detection and form research sub-teams.
   - Familiarize new collaborators with existing literature, tools, and processes.
   - Set up Slack channels, weekly stand-ups, and project management boards.

2. **Month 3–4: Data Gathering & Preliminary Experiments**
   - Collect or source datasets (EEG, MRI, wearable sensor data, etc.).
   - Develop preliminary machine learning models or signal processing pipelines.
   - Identify potential biomarkers and refine hypotheses.

3. **Month 5–6: Prototype Development**
   - Build and test prototypes for early detection (hardware, software, or both).
   - Perform initial validation on small-scale clinical or simulated data.
   - Document findings in shared repositories for peer review.

4. **Month 7–8: Optimization & Validation**
   - Improve accuracy, speed, and usability of prototypes.
   - Test in more extensive or diverse settings (larger datasets).
   - Discuss feedback in weekly Slack sessions and pivot as needed.

5. **Month 9–10: Analysis & Iteration**
   - Deep-dive into performance metrics.
   - Initiate advanced statistical or machine learning methods to enhance detection.
   - Publish intermediate results in relevant forums or internal reports.

6. **Month 11–12: Publication & Future Roadmap**
   - Consolidate findings into research papers, open-access data resources, and/or patents.
   - Present results at conferences or through webinars.
   - Outline the next phase of research, additional collaborations, and extended goals.
